<h1> This is the Masters Of Mayhem's IT Website </h1>
<h2> These are our team's background's for drone flying and building. </h2>
<h3> Michael: I've been flying drones for three years and am the most experienced team member. Also holds the longest time in the school for drone flying and captured a silver medal. </h3>
<h3> Lachlan: I've never flown drones before this challenge, but I hold the bronze medal along with others competitors and my teammates respectively. I designed a drone for the group but was unsuccessful.</h3>
<h3> Baylee: I've flown helicopters before but not drones, I also flew the drone for the first time and succeeded with landing the drone onto the roof. He has helped us build the winning drone.</h3>
<h3> Jack: I've flown drones for two years and somehow broke our first successful drone, I have the fastest time with repairing drones in our group and I am the only person to cut out the rotors while it was in the air. </h3>
<h3> Griffin: I am one of the original members in the group and I am the only Year 8 to participate in the competition.
<h3> NEWEST MEMBER: Matthew: I have flown drones but find flying helicopters easier, new to the group but are helpful to the group.
