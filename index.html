<h3> Michael: I've been flying drones for three years and am the most experienced team member. Also holds the longest time in the school for drone flying and also got all additional medals except one. </h3>
<h3> Lachlan: I've never flown drones before this challenge, but I hold the bronze medal along with others competitors and my teammates respectively. I was able to get a gold medal also.</h3>
<h3> Baylee: I've flown helicopters before but not drones, I also flew the drone for the first time and succeeded with landing the drone onto the roof. He has helped us build the winning drone.</h3>
<h3> Jack: I've flown drones for two years and somehow broke our first successful drone, I have the fastest time with repairing drones in our group and I am the only person to cut out the rotors while it was in the air. </h3>
